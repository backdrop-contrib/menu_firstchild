Menu First Child
======================

Menu Firstchild enables you to create a parent item, without any path, that
links to its first viewable child item.

This module makes alterations to menu items so that "<firstchild>" can be
used to send the visitor to the first viewable child item below the menu
item that uses it. Similar in fashion to how "<front>" is used in paths for
going to the front page.

Simply by installing and enabling the module, the functionality of
"<firstchild>" becomes available.

This module has been ported from version 7.x-1.1+1-dev.
